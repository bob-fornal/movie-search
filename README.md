As a user:

- [ ] I can search for movies and see a paginated list of results.
- [ ] I can filter search results by genre.
- [ ] I can navigate through the next and previous pages of the paginated results.
- [ ] I see the total count of search results.
- [ ] I see notable information for each search result, such as the summary, poster, duration, rating, etc.

To do:

- [ ] Build out API service to get auth and make first call for data.
- [ ] Build out frontend search (by title only?).
- [ ] Build out frontend retrieve and filter by genre (paged?).
- [ ] Add page navigation of results with position and totals.
- [ ] Build out frontend cards to display notable information based on results.
